Introduction
============

SharePast was intented to be a social project allowing people to 
share information with friends about events occured some time ago. 

It was statred mostly as a technical curiosity to play with 
Spring, Grails, Sitemesh and a bunch of other open source projects. 

Currently this projects includes the following technologies:

0) Maven for build and dep management
1) Hierirchal configuration (based on property files)
2) Groovy based Logback configuration
3) Run-time discovery Spring Bootstrap Mechanism (Google Reflections)
4) Spring Security integration
5) Spring integration with Grails
6) Runtime Grails conviguration through Spring beans
7) Hibernate DAO layer (over C3P0)
8) AspectJ compile time class weaving
9) Automatic mock data setup for different environemnts (Liquibase)
10) Basic Grails application
11) Many more, which I probably forgot 

The project is fully working and ca be started up. Instructions on how to build and run bellow.
This project can be used as a reference point and a learning tutorial for misc aspects of Spring, 
Grails, Hibernate... I spend a lot of time debugging though all of those frameworks to make it all work, 
so hopefully it will help you to save some of your time.
